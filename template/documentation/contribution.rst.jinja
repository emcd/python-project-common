*******************************************************************************
Contribution
*******************************************************************************

Contribution to this project is welcome! However, it must follow the `code of
conduct
<https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/contribution/conduct.rst>`_
for the project.


Ways to Contribute
===============================================================================

* File bug reports and feature requests in the `issue tracker
  <https://github.com/{{ gh_owner }}/{{ project_name }}/issues>`_. (Please try
  to avoid duplicate issues.)

* Fork the repository and submit `pull requests
  <https://github.com/{{ gh_owner }}/{{ project_name }}/pulls>`_ to improve the
  source code or documentation. Pull requests should follow the development
  guidance and standards below.


Development
===============================================================================

Guidance and Standards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Follow the `development environment preparation and management instructions
  <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/environment.rst>`_
  to ensure consistency with maintainer development environments and CI
  workflows.

* Adhere to the `development practices
  <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/practices.rst>`_
  and `code style <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/style.rst>`_
  to improve the probability of pull request acceptance. You may wish to use an
  LLM to assist with this, if the standards seem too onerous or specific.

* Also consider the `nomenclature advice
  <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/nomenclature.rst>`_
  for consistency and to improve the probability of pull request acceptance.

* Prepare changelog fragments according to the `releases guide
  <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/releases.rst>`_
  as appropriate.

* Although unncessary for non-maintainer contributions, additional background
  can be found in the `maintenance guide
  <https://github.com/emcd/python-project-common/blob/master/documentation/sphinx/development/maintenance.rst>`_.
