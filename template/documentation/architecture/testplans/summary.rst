*******************************************************************************
Test Organization Summary
*******************************************************************************

Overview
===============================================================================

This section contains comprehensive test planning documentation, including test
organization conventions, coverage strategies, and detailed implementation
plans for achieving systematic test coverage.

Test plans follow project testing principles described in the `common test
development guidelines
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emcd/python-project-common/refs/tags/docs-1/documentation/common/tests.rst>`_.
Key principles include:

- **Dependency injection over monkey-patching** for testable code architecture
- **Systematic coverage analysis** with clear gap identification
- **Performance-conscious resource use** with appropriate testing strategies
- **Organized test structure** with numbered modules and functions

Test Planning Process
===============================================================================

The test planning process systematically addresses:

**Coverage Gap Analysis**
  Identification of all uncovered lines and untested functionality across modules

**Test Strategy Development**  
  Comprehensive approaches for testing each function, class, and method with
  appropriate test data strategies

**Implementation Guidance**
  Detailed plans for achieving coverage while following project testing principles

**Architectural Considerations**
  Analysis of testability constraints and recommendations for maintaining
  clean, testable code

Test Module Numbering Scheme
===============================================================================

.. todo:: Define project-specific test module numbering conventions.

Test Function Numbering
===============================================================================

Within each test module, functions are numbered by component:

- **000-099**: Basic functionality tests for the module  
- **100-199, 200-299, etc.**: Each function/class gets its own 100-number block
- **Increments of 10-20**: For closely related test variations within a block

Project-Specific Testing Conventions
===============================================================================

For detailed testing conventions, patterns, and guidelines, refer to the `common
test development guidelines
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emcd/python-project-common/refs/tags/docs-1/documentation/common/tests.rst>`_.
This includes:

- Coverage goals and strategies
- Performance considerations
- Test data organization patterns
- Dependency injection approaches
- Resource management during testing
