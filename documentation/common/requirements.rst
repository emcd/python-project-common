*******************************************************************************
Requirements Documentation
*******************************************************************************

This guide covers requirements documentation practices, including Product
Requirements Documents (PRDs) and related requirements gathering standards.

Product Requirements Document
===============================================================================

The Product Requirements Document (PRD) serves as the authoritative source for
what a product should do, who it serves, and how success will be measured. It
bridges business objectives with technical implementation.

Purpose and Benefits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand product goals and scope.
* **Prioritization**: Provide clear criteria for making trade-off decisions.
* **Acceptance criteria**: Define measurable success conditions.
* **Communication**: Facilitate discussion between business and technical teams.
* **Change management**: Track requirement evolution throughout development.

PRD Structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following structure for product requirements documents:

.. code-block:: rst

    *******************************************************************************
    Product Requirements Document
    *******************************************************************************

    Executive Summary
    ===============================================================================

    [Brief overview of the product, its purpose, and key benefits. Should be
    understandable by any stakeholder.]

    Problem Statement
    ===============================================================================

    [Clear description of the problem this product solves. Include:
    - Who experiences the problem
    - When and where it occurs
    - Impact and consequences of the problem
    - Current workarounds or solutions and their limitations]

    Goals and Objectives
    ===============================================================================

    [Specific, measurable goals the product should achieve. Include:
    - Primary objectives (must-have outcomes)
    - Secondary objectives (nice-to-have outcomes)
    - Success metrics and how they will be measured]

    Target Users
    ===============================================================================

    [Description of intended users including:
    - User personas or roles
    - User needs and motivations
    - Technical proficiency levels
    - Usage contexts and environments]

    Functional Requirements
    ===============================================================================

    [Detailed description of what the product must do. Organize by feature area
    or user workflow. For each requirement include:
    - Requirement ID (for traceability)
    - Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
    - User story format when appropriate
    - Acceptance criteria]

    Non-Functional Requirements
    ===============================================================================

    [Technical and quality requirements including:
    - Performance requirements (response time, throughput, etc.)
    - Scalability requirements
    - Security requirements
    - Reliability and availability requirements
    - Usability requirements
    - Compatibility requirements]

    Constraints and Assumptions
    ===============================================================================

    [Known limitations and assumptions including:
    - Technical constraints (platforms, technologies, etc.)
    - Regulatory or compliance constraints
    - Dependencies on other systems or teams
    - Assumptions about user behavior or technical environment]

    Out of Scope
    ===============================================================================

    [Explicitly state what will NOT be included to prevent scope creep and
    manage expectations.]

Best Practices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Requirement Quality**

* **Specific**: Requirements should be unambiguous and precise.
* **Measurable**: Include quantifiable acceptance criteria where possible.
* **Achievable**: Ensure requirements are technically and practically feasible.
* **Relevant**: Each requirement should trace back to business objectives.
* **Testable**: Requirements should be verifiable through testing or inspection.

**User Story Format**

When appropriate, express functional requirements as user stories:

.. code-block:: text

    As a [user role], I want [functionality] so that [business value].

    Acceptance Criteria:
    - [Specific condition that must be met]
    - [Another condition that must be met]
    - [Edge case or error condition handling]

**Prioritization Guidelines**

* **Critical**: Product cannot launch without this feature.
* **High**: Important for product success but could be delayed if necessary.
* **Medium**: Valuable enhancement that improves user experience.
* **Low**: Nice-to-have feature that can be considered for future releases.

**Traceability**

* Assign unique identifiers to requirements (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.).
* Maintain traceability from business objectives through requirements to test cases.
* Update requirement status as development progresses.

Requirements Management
===============================================================================

Change Control
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Document changes**: Track all requirement changes with rationale.
* **Impact assessment**: Evaluate effects on schedule, resources, and other requirements.
* **Stakeholder approval**: Ensure appropriate sign-off for requirement changes.
* **Communication**: Notify affected teams of requirement updates.

Review and Validation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Technical feasibility**: Validate requirements with development teams.
* **User validation**: Test requirements with actual users when possible.
* **Consistency checking**: Ensure requirements don't conflict with each other.

Integration with Development
===============================================================================

* **Architecture alignment**: Ensure requirements inform architectural decisions.
* **Sprint planning**: Break requirements into implementable user stories.
* **Acceptance testing**: Use requirements as the basis for acceptance test criteria.
* **Progress tracking**: Monitor development progress against requirements completion.
