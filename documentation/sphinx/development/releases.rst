Changelog Entries
===============================================================================

The project uses `Towncrier <https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/>`_ to manage its
changelog. When making changes that should be noted in the changelog, add a
file ("fragment") to the ``documentation/towncrier`` directory with of
``<issue_number>.<type>.rst``, for changes with a Github issue, or
``+<title>.<type>.rst``, for changes without an associated issue number.

The entries will be collected and organized when a release is made, as
described in the release process sections above.

Available Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ``bugfix``: For bug fixes
* ``docs``: For documentation improvements
* ``feature``: For new features
* ``platform``: For changes to supported platforms
* ``removal``: For deprecations and removals

Format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file should contain a concise description of the change written in present
tense. For example:

.. code-block:: rst
   :caption: documentation/towncrier/+immutable-modules.feature.rst

   Add support for immutable module reclassification.

The description should:

* Start with a capital letter
* End with a period
* Use present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
* Focus on the what and why, not the how
* Be understandable by users, not just developers
