Product Requirements Document
*******************************************************************************

Executive Summary
===============================================================================

The Python Project Common repository provides a comprehensive suite of tools, 
templates, and workflows to streamline Python project development. It consists 
of three primary components: a Copier template for project scaffolding, 
reusable GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation, and a Python package 
(emcd-projects) for project maintenance tasks.

The project aims to eliminate setup friction, ensure consistent quality 
standards, and reduce maintenance overhead for Python open source projects.

Problem Statement
===============================================================================

Python developers and project maintainers face several recurring challenges:

**Who experiences the problem:**
- Python package developers creating new projects
- Open source maintainers managing multiple repositories  
- Development teams establishing consistent tooling standards
- Contributors working across projects with different conventions

**When and where it occurs:**
- During initial project setup and scaffolding
- When establishing CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment
- While maintaining documentation sites and coverage reporting
- When enforcing code quality standards across repositories

**Impact and consequences:**
- Time wasted on repetitive setup tasks instead of feature development
- Inconsistent tooling and quality standards across projects
- Manual maintenance of documentation sites and coverage reports
- Fragmented workflows requiring external services (ReadTheDocs, Codecov)

**Current workarounds and limitations:**
- Manual project setup with copy-paste configuration
- Individual GitHub Actions workflows duplicated across repositories
- Reliance on external services for documentation hosting and reporting
- Ad-hoc quality assurance processes without standardization

Goals and Objectives
===============================================================================

**Primary Objectives (Critical)**

REQ-001: **Rapid Project Bootstrapping** (Critical)
  Enable developers to create fully-configured Python projects in minutes, not hours.
  Success Metric: Project setup time reduced from 2+ hours to <5 minutes.

REQ-002: **Consistent Quality Standards** (Critical)
  Enforce uniform code quality, testing, and documentation standards across all projects.
  Success Metric: 100% of generated projects pass linting, typing, and testing requirements.

REQ-003: **Self-Contained Documentation** (Critical)
  Eliminate dependencies on external documentation and reporting services.
  Success Metric: Generated projects include complete static site infrastructure.

**Secondary Objectives (High)**

REQ-004: **Multi-Platform CI/CD** (High)
  Provide comprehensive testing across Python versions and operating systems.
  Success Metric: Support for Python 3.9+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

REQ-005: **Maintenance Automation** (High)
  Automate routine maintenance tasks for project lifecycle management.
  Success Metric: Reduce manual maintenance overhead by >75%.

**Success Metrics**
- Project setup time: <5 minutes from template to working development environment
- Quality gate compliance: 100% of generated projects pass all QA checks
- Documentation coverage: Complete static site with versioned docs and reports
