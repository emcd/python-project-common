# Documentation Improvements for @documentation/common

## Structural and Coverage Improvements

### 1. Rust Expansion (High Priority)
The practices.rst file has a TODO to expand Rust practices. Consider adding:
- Import organization patterns for Rust modules
- Error handling conventions with `Result` and custom error types  
- Type usage patterns (when to use generics, lifetimes, traits)
- Documentation standards for Rust code (similar to Python's narrative mood guidance)
- Performance optimization patterns
- Async/await conventions

### 2. Security Guidelines (Missing)
Add a dedicated `security.rst` file covering:
- Input validation patterns
- Secret management practices (environment variables, key rotation)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning workflows
- Code review security checklists
- Safe handling of user data and PII

### 3. API Design Guidelines (Missing)
Create an `api-design.rst` covering:
- REST API design principles
- GraphQL schema patterns
- Error response formats
- Versioning strategies
- Rate limiting and pagination patterns

## Content Enhancement

### 4. Testing Improvements
The tests.rst is well-structured but could benefit from:
- **Property-based testing** guidance (using Hypothesis)
- **Integration testing** patterns with external dependencies
- **Performance testing** conventions
- **Flaky test** debugging strategies
- **Test data management** best practices

### 5. Maintenance Enhancements
The maintenance.rst file is sparse. Add sections on:
- **Dependency management** workflows (lockfile updates, security patches)
- **Database migration** strategies
- **Monitoring and observability** setup
- **Backup and disaster recovery** procedures
- **Performance profiling** and optimization workflows

### 6. Environment Setup Modernization
Update environment.rst with:
- **Container-based development** options (Docker, devcontainers)
- **IDE configuration** recommendations (VS Code settings, extensions)
- **Alternative tooling** options (ruff vs flake8, uv vs pip)
- **Troubleshooting** common setup issues

### 6.1. MCP Server Troubleshooting (from language-server-cleanup analysis)
Add user-facing documentation about MCP language server issues:
- **MCP server state problems** - when tools freeze or become unresponsive
- **Version compatibility issues** - between mcp-language-server and language servers
- **Manual restart procedures** - how users can reconnect MCP servers in Claude Code
- **Alternative workflows** - fallback approaches when MCP tools aren't working

## Documentation Quality

### 7. Cross-Reference Integration
Improve internal linking between guides:
- Add more `:doc:` references between related concepts
- Create an index/glossary of key terms
- Add "See also" sections to connect related practices

### 8. Real-World Examples
Expand beyond simple examples with:
- **Complete module examples** showing all practices together
- **Migration guides** from anti-patterns to preferred patterns
- **Decision trees** for choosing between alternatives
- **Common gotchas** and their solutions

### 9. Language-Agnostic Guidelines
Create a `general-practices.rst` for principles that apply across languages:
- **Code review** standards and checklists
- **Documentation** principles (README structure, changelog formats)
- **Version control** conventions (branch naming, commit messaging)
- **Project organization** patterns

### 10. Tooling Integration
Add `tooling.rst` covering:
- **Editor configuration** (editorconfig, language servers)
- **CI/CD** pipeline patterns
- **Code quality tools** configuration and integration
- **Automated formatting** and linting workflows

## Missing Specialized Guides

### 11. Performance Guidelines
Create `performance.rst` covering:
- **Profiling** methodologies
- **Memory management** patterns
- **Database optimization** strategies
- **Caching** strategies and patterns

### 12. Debugging Guidelines
Add `debugging.rst` with:
- **Logging** best practices and structured logging
- **Error reporting** and monitoring setup
- **Debugging techniques** for different environments
- **Troubleshooting methodologies**

## Immediate High-Impact Actions

1. **Complete the Rust practices section** - this addresses the existing TODO
2. **Add security.rst** - critical for any production codebase
3. **Expand maintenance.rst** - essential for long-term project health
4. **Create cross-references** between existing guides to improve navigation

## Notes

The documentation is already quite comprehensive and well-structured. These improvements would make it even more valuable as a reference for maintaining consistent, high-quality codebases across Python and Rust projects.

Priority order:
- High: Rust expansion, security guidelines, maintenance enhancements
- Medium: Testing improvements, cross-references, real-world examples
- Lower: API design, performance guidelines, debugging guidelines

Consider implementing these incrementally, starting with the high-priority items that address existing TODOs and critical gaps.
