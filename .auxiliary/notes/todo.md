# TODO Items

- Suppress PyPy 3.11 with Rust extension until Maturin supports it.
- Suppress Python 3.13 and 3.14 with Rust extension until Maturin supports it.

## Future Enhancements

### Documentation URL Support for docs-* Tags

**Goal:** Enable pointing to published HTML documentation around specific `docs-*` tags instead of always referencing `/stable/` documentation.

**Current State:** Common documentation URLs in templates currently point to `/stable/sphinx-html/common/` paths at the `python-project-common` GitHub pages.

**Desired State:** Support referencing documentation at specific tag-based URLs (e.g., `/docs-1/sphinx-html/common/`) to allow for version-specific documentation linking.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Modify `sources/emcdproj/website.py` to support publishing documentation for `docs-*` tags
- Update template URL patterns to support configurable documentation versions
- Consider backward compatibility with existing `/stable/` references

**Priority:** Future enhancement - current `/stable/` approach is functional for immediate needs.

### Add Github Release Poller to Release Workflow
**Goal:** Improve release workflow reliability by ensuring Github release is registered before artifact publication.
**Details:** Add polling step to wait for Github API to register new release before attempting to publish artifacts. Current workflow occasionally fails due to API delays.
**Why:** Solves real production reliability issue we've experienced.

### Improve Test Coverage
**Goal:** Increase test coverage while avoiding integration test hazards.
**Details:** Carefully add tests for uncovered code paths, being mindful of integration tests that might clobber production state. Focus on unit tests and safe integration scenarios.
**Challenges:** Need to identify safe vs. risky integration test scenarios.

### Add MCP Server Support to Claude GitHub Workflow
**Goal:** Enhance automated code analysis and testing capabilities.
**Details:** Add useful MCP servers (text-editor, pyright, context7) to the claude GitHub workflow to improve code quality and analysis automation.
**Why:** Could significantly improve automated testing and code analysis capabilities.

### Release Workflow Enhancements
**Goal:** Further improve release automation and reliability.
**Ideas:**
- Automated release notes generation improvements
- Multi-stage release validation
- Rollback procedures documentation
- Release metrics and monitoring
